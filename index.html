          Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is
          lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose
          implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and
          make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with
          object-oriented capabilities. AvaScript was first known as LiveScript,
          but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the
          excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first
          appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The
          general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape,
          Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.

          be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be
          interpreted by the browser. <br />
          It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, <br />
          but can include programs that interact with the user, control the
          browser, <br />
          and dynamically create HTML content. <br />
          The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over
          traditional CGI server-side scripts. <br />
          For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered
          <br />
          a valid e-mail address in a form field.

        <div class="answer" hidden>
          The merits of using JavaScript are: <br />
          Less server interaction: <br />
          You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server.
          <br />
          This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.
          <br />
          Immediate feedback to the visitors: <br />
          They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have
          forgotten to enter something. Increased interactivity: <br />
          You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them
          with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard. Richer interfaces:
          <br />
          You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and drop <br />
          components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.

          The ECMAScript Edition 5 standard will be the first update to be
          released in over four years. <br />
          JavaScript 2.0 conforms to Edition 5 of the ECMAScript standard,
          <br />
          and the difference between the two is extremely minor. <br />
          The specification for JavaScript 2.0 can be found on the following
          <br />
          site: http://www.ecmascript.org/ Today, Netscape's JavaScript and
          Microsoft's <br />
          JScript conform to the ECMAScript standard, <br />
          although both the languages still support the features that are not a
          part of the standard.
